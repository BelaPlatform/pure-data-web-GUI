#X text 40 28 You can use "qlist" or "textfile" objects for sequencing.
Qlist is simpler to use than the (more versatile) textfile.;

#X floatatom 282 174 0 0 0 0 - - - 0;
#X text 52 221 The "add" messages add lines to the qlist \, so that
it contains:;
#X text 159 257 receive1 1;
#X text 158 278 1000 receive1 0;
#X text 159 298 receive2 2;
#X text 157 318 1000 receive2 0;
#X text 159 336 receive1 3;
#X text 57 428 If you have more than 5 lines or so you will probably
want to store them as a separate file and have qlist read it. You can
also write files \, set tempo \, and single step... see the help patch
for details.;
#X text 57 378 and the "bang" instructs qlist to play the sequence
by sending messages to "receive" objects. Messages starting with numbers
request that amount of delay.;

#X text 522 28 A more recent and powerful addition is the "text" object
that can perform many text operations and substitute both "qlist" and
"textfile"., f 49;
#X text 523 86 You can use 'text sequence' in a way similar to 'qlist'.
Click on 'text define' to see the text messages to be sequenced. Note
that it is the same as added to 'qlist'., f 49;
